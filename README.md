The rapid growth of data collection has led to a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.

They are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autaplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and sucees.
In this kernel we'll be building a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.



For novices like me this kernel will pretty much serve as a foundation in recommendation systems and will provide you with something to start with Content Based Filtering
In this recommender system the content of the movie (overview, cast, crew, keyword, tagline,genres,director etc) is used to find its similarity with other movies. Then the movies that are most likely to be similar are recommended.
